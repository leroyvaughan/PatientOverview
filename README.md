# PatientOverview
Sample page from the IDEAS platform I worked on at Pono Health.  I used a mockup for the actual page in the Pono Health Application.  This is just a sample of the work I was doing with Google Visualizations and JavaScript.

*For the data grid I used AngularJS insted of DevExpress, which is what we used there.
